# Lab notebook for CSE185 Final Project
## Beverlie Poblete
## PID A11334034

### Lab Session 1.  May 22, 2018.
#### Goal: list at least 3 datasets you're interested in (accession #'s and a brief description)
1. Find possible papers I want to elaborate upon:
* [http://jvi.asm.org/content/87/1/503.full] Deep RNA Sequencing Reveals Complex Transcriptional Landscape of a Bat Adenovirus
* [https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/9/1105/203994] TopHat: discovering splice junctions with RNA-Seq 
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245950/] Ultrasensitive detection of rare mutations using next-generation targeted resequencing.
* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160615301305#f0005] Epigenetic modification maintains intrinsic limb-cell identity in Xenopus limb bud regeneration

2. Find 3 relevant datasets:
* SRA access #: SRX1493621  -  Hindlimb RNAs from T3-treated Xenopus tropicalis (10G)
* SRA access #: DRX040459 -Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing of SAMD00028957 (1.7G)
* SRA access #: DRX040458 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/DRX040458[accn] (1.8G)

### Lab Session 2.  May 24, 2018.
#### Goal: one sentence about the biological question for the dataset you chose; also sign up for lightning talks
